# online-shopping-selenium

The project includes a regression flow for an online shopping application, covering key processes like selecting products, adding them to the cart, proceeding to checkout, and validating the final amount. It features the Page Object Model (POM) for better maintainability, along with generic functions, assertions, and support for cross-browser testing.
